	"details": "The **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense** is a completely new board on a well-known form factor. It comes with a series of embedded sensors:\n\n- 9 axis inertial sensor: what makes this board ideal for wearable devices\n- Humidity, and temperature sensor: to get highly accurate measurements of the environmental conditions\n- Barometric sensor: you could make a simple weather station\n- Microphone: to capture and analyse sound in real time\n- Gesture, proximity, light color and light intensity sensor : estimate the room’s luminosity, but also whether someone is moving close to the board.",
