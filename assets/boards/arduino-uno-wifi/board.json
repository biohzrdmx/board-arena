	"tagline": "The Arduino for your educational projects with wireless connectivity and motion sensing.",
	"details": "The **Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2** is the easiest point of entry to basic IoT with the standard form factor of the UNO family. Whether you are looking at building a sensor network connected to your office or home router, or if you want to create a BLE device sending data to a cellphone, the Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2 is your one-stop-solution for many of the basic IoT application scenarios.\n\nAdd this board to a device and you'll be able to connect it to a WiFi network, using its secure ECC608 crypto chip accelerator. The Arduino Uno WiFi is functionally the same as the Arduino Uno Rev3, but with the addition of WiFi / Bluetooth and some other enhancements. It incorporates the brand new ATmega4809 8-bit microcontroller from Microchip and has an onboard IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) LSM6DS3TR.",
